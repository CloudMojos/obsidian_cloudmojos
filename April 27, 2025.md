I think I have found enlightenment and want to use Obsidian moving forward. I had a revelation of using it because I have found that I want to link files the way I do here in Notion. I also like the idea that I could just create a tag or link whenever I feel like it in between sentences. That's like the ultimate blogging tool. Like, right now, I'm going to link a non-existing note that is called [[Why do I always whisper to myself that I want to die.]]. That TBW blogpost will be written when I finally have something meaningful to write. I also like that I probably know how to navigate between my journals now. I like it.
